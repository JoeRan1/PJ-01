Job Seeker Applications Analysis Project
Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of job seeker applications on the HH website. The analysis will focus on understanding trends, patterns, and insights derived from the data of job applications submitted by users on the HH platform.

Project Objectives
Data Collection:

Gather job seeker application data from the HH website, including information such as job titles, applicant profiles, application dates, and more.
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Cleanse and preprocess the collected data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Handle missing values, outliers, and data formatting issues as necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within the job seeker application data. Use visualizations and statistical techniques to gain insights.
Application Trends Analysis:

Analyze trends in job applications over time, including seasonal variations, popular job categories, geographic distribution of applicants, and application frequency.
Applicant Profile Analysis:

Explore characteristics of job applicants, such as skills, experience levels, education backgrounds, and preferences. Identify common traits among successful applicants.
Performance Metrics Calculation:
